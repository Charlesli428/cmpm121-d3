# D3: World of Bits

## Vision

A map-based crafting game where the world is a grid. Cells may contain tokens.
Players collect nearby tokens and merge tokens of the same value to make larger
ones until reaching a target value.

## Technologies

- TypeScript
- Vite + Deno
- Leaflet for map and grid
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## D3.a: Core Mechanics

### Steps (only the next few steps, not the whole project)

- [ ] Step 1: Delete everything in src/main.ts and start with a blank file.
- [ ] Step 2: Initialize a basic Leaflet map centered on the classroom coordinates.
- [ ] Step 3: Make the map full screen using CSS and confirm deployment works.
- [ ] Step 4: Add a marker at the player’s fixed position (no GPS yet).
- [ ] Step 5: Render one test cell (a rectangle) on the map.
- [ ] Step 6: Add a loop to draw a grid of cells around the player.

### Done Criteria for D3.a

- [ ] Map loads and scrolls on desktop + mobile.
- [ ] Cells are visible and cover the map.
- [ ] Tokens in cells are visible with deterministic values.
- [ ] Player can pick up, drop, and merge tokens in nearby cells.
- [ ] Game can detect when a crafted token reaches the target value.
